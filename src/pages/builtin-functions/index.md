description: Built-in functions in scryptTS

ScryptTS has a wide array of useful built-in functions. The most commonly used built-in function is `assert(cond: boolean)`. It throws an error if `cond` is false. A contract call is successful if and only if all arguments passed to the `assert` functions are true.

The full list of functions can be found in the [scryptTS reference](https://scrypt.io/scrypt-ts/reference/).
