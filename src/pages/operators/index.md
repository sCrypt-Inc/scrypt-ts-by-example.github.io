**scryptTS** is a subset of TypeScript. Only the following TypeScript operators can be used directly.

Note `**` is not supported currently.

### Bitwise Operators

TypeScript's bitwise operator cannot be used in scryptTS. But you can use the bitwise built-in function provided by scryptTS.

| Operator              |         Description          | built-in function |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------: | :---------------: |
| `&`                   |         Bitwise AND          |    `and(x,y)`     |
| <code> &#124; </code> |          Bitwise OR          |     `or(x,y)`     |
| `^`                   |         Bitwise XOR          |    `xor(x,y)`     |
| `~`                   |         Bitwise NOT          |   `invert(x,y)`   |
| `<<`                  |          Left shift          |   `lshift(x,y)`   |
| `>>`                  | Sign-propagating right shift |   `rshift(x,y)`   |

The number in the Bitcoin virtual machine is saved in the [Signâ€“magnitude format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations) in stack, not the [two's complement format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations) commonly used by computers. If the operands participating in the operation are all positive numbers, the result of the operation is consistent with TypeScript's bitwise operator. (except `~`). Otherwise, the operation results may be inconsistent.
